# üß† NLP Pipeline for SDOH Extraction from Clinical Notes

This project implements a full pipeline for extracting Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) from clinical notes using BioLinkBERT + BioBERT. It includes:

- NLM Scrubber de-identification
- Cleaning & preprocessing
- Entity extraction with BioLinkBERT
- BIO tagging format conversion
- BioBERT model fine-tuning
- Final inference on new notes
